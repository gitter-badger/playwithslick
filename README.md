This is Play  & Slick template.In this template, I am going to describe how to write a web application with their  unit tests and integration tests.I am working with  Test driven development environment so my primary focus is unit test for all functionality.

Technology overview:<br>
Lets start with <b>Play framework</b> . Play is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture.
Built on Akka, Play provides predictable and minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) for highly-scalable applications.For more info: https://www.playframework.com

<b>Slick</b> is a modern database query and access library for Scala. It allows you to work with stored data almost as if you were using Scala collections while at the same time giving you full control over when a database access happens and which data is transferred. You can write your database queries in Scala instead of SQL, thus profiting from the static checking, compile-time safety and compositionality of Scala. Slick features an extensible query compiler which can generate code for different backends.For more info: http://slick.typesafe.com/

<b>PostgreSQL</b> is the worldâ€™s most advanced open source database. Developed over 25 years by a vibrant and independent open source community.

<b>H2</b> is a relational database management system written in Java. It is basically  used for unit testing of all database queries.

<b>Scala test</b> is  a testing framework.
